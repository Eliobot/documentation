Eliobot backpacks are modules that add extra features to Eliobot.
There are several models, each with a specific function.

## Use with Elioblocs

All blocks associated with backpacks are grouped in the <img src={require("@site/static/img/eliobot/backpacks/category-backpacks.jpg").default} style={{ width: "14%", verticalAlign: "middle" }} alt="backpacks category" /> category.

## Use with Python

Each backpack uses one or more pins to function and can use different communication protocols.
You can find the documentation for your backpack in the list below.

## Pin Configuration

Each backpack has a specific pin configuration. You can find the pin configuration of your backpack in the associated documentation.
