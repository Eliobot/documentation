## BME280 Sensor Documentation

---

### 1. **Introduction**

The BME280 is a high-precision sensor that measures temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure.
It is commonly used in environmental monitoring, weather stations due to its reliability.
The sensor communicates via the I2C interface.

### 2. **Technical Characteristics**

- **Temperature Range**: -40 to 85°C (accuracy of ±1.0°C)
- **Humidity Range**: 0% to 100% RH (accuracy of ±3% RH)
- **Pressure Range**: 300 to 1100 hPa (accuracy of ±1 hPa)
- **Operating Voltage**: 1.8V to 3.6V
- **Interface**: I2C (default) or SPI
- **Dimensions**: 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm x 0.93 mm
- **Power Consumption**: 0.1 µA in sleep mode, 1.8 µA at 1 Hz sampling rate

### 4. **Using BME280 with CircuitPython**

**Library Installation**:

1. The library installs automatically if you use a code block that uses the DHT11 backpack in Elioblocs.

2. Otherwise Install the library `Adafruit CircuitPython BME280` using the Library Bundle [CircuitPython from Adafruit](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

**Code Example**:

```python
import time
import board
import adafruit_bme280

# Initialize BME280 sensor
i2c = busio.I2C(board.IO9, board.IO8)
bme280 = adafruit_bme280.Adafruit_BME280_I2C(i2c, address=0x76)

# Optionally set sea-level pressure based on your location
bme280.sea_level_pressure = 1013.25

while True:
    print(f"Temperature: {bme280.temperature:.1f} °C")
    print(f"Humidity: {bme280.humidity:.1f} %")
    print(f"Pressure: {bme280.pressure:.1f} hPa")
    print(f"Altitude: {bme280.altitude:.2f} meters")

    time.sleep(2.0)
```

**Notes**:

- The `sea_level_pressure` variable can be adjusted based on your location for more accurate altitude readings.
