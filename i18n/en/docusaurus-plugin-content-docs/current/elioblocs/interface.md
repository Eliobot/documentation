Here is how the interface is organized. This explanation will help you for the rest of the tutorial.

> 1. The toolbox (the space where you will find all the blocks necessary for programming).
> 
> 2. The workspace (this is where you can assemble your blocks).
> 
> 3. Tabs allowing you to access tutorials, help, as well as see the code that will be written when you place blocks.
>     
> 4. The buttons:
> - Clear everything: to clean your workspace in one click.
> - Import: opens a previously saved program.
> - Save: save your program on your computer.
> - Connect: to connect Eliobot to your computer.
> - Upload: to send the code to Eliobot.
> 
> 5. The terminal (this is where you can see error or success messages from your program and communicate with Eliobot).
