In Elioblocs, there are three main categories of blocks:
- Boolean blocks
- Value blocks
- Command blocks

## Boolean blocks

Boolean blocks allow you to perform tests and comparisons. They return `true` or `false`.
They are represented by diamond-shaped blocks.

## Blocks of values

Value blocks allow you to manipulate numbers, texts and lists.
They are represented by blocks in the shape of a horizontal oval.

## Command blocks

Command blocks allow you to perform actions. They are represented by rectangle-shaped blocks in different ways.
