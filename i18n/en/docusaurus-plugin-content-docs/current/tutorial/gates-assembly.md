# Construire des obstacles

That's it, your robot is assembled? What if I told you that there might still be a surprise at the bottom of your box!

Lift the top cardboard sheets to find a final sheet with rounded corners at the bottom of the cardboard.

Take this plate and separate it in two.

Then detach the two elements in the center of each half plate, these are the feet.
The other “U” shaped element is the door
