# Add the line sensor


> :memo: **Note** <br></br>
This update only concerns Eliobot robots marketed before August 1, 2023. 
After this date the update is already done during production.


All Eliobot robots are designed to accommodate a line sensor, but the first batches were not equipped with one. In this case it is possible to request the sensor [to this address](https://forms.gle/Y3mQPfNaEa1iAnsq5).

In this tutorial we will explain to you how to equip Eliobot with this new sensor.

You will need the following materials:

- Your Eliobot robot
- The line sensor
- The line sensor socket
- The assembly support
- A soldering iron
- Tin
- A screwdriver

The Eliobots requiring this operation are only those that do not have a socket underneath at the front. If the socket is already present, all you have to do is plug in the sensor by putting the rounded part towards the front.

In this case, Eliobot is already equipped to receive the sensor.

In this case, follow this tutorial carefully to add line tracking.


## Preparation

Before starting welding, you need to prepare Eliobot a little.

We start by removing the battery to avoid any risk in the event of improper handling.

We then dismantle the front bumper.

Then we slide the assembly support onto the sensor socket.

Finally, we insert the plug into the row of holes and place Eliobot right side up on the table. It is important to check that all pins of the socket protrude from the electronic board.

Is Eliobot ready? Let's go for welding! 😎


## Welding

> :warning: **Warning** :warning:<br></br>
Soldering requires handling a soldering iron, which can cause burns if used incorrectly.

Now is the time to heat the soldering iron to around 350°C. Once hot, place a little tin on the tip of the iron to facilitate soldering.

To solder the through pins, place the tip of the iron (1) at the same time on the pad (2) and the pin (3) and let it heat up for 1 second. A little tin (4) is then deposited to form a solder cone around the pin and the pad.

Once the cone is formed, remove the iron, wait a few seconds for the solder to set, then move on to the next pin.

This is what the welds should look like when finished. The tin forms a shiny, continuous cone around the pin and the pad.

## Reassembly

Well done, you have just completed your first welds!
We are now going to finish assembling Eliobot.

We start by connecting the line sensor into the socket that we have just soldered.

:warning: Pay attention to the direction: The rounded part of the sensor goes towards the front. :warning:

We can then reassemble the front bumper.

And finally, we put the battery back, respecting the (+) and the (-)

And there you have it, Eliobot has just gained a new sensor, as well as lots of new abilities that go with it! 😍

In particular, it will be able to follow a line, we explain all that to you in this tutorial:
