# Premier programme

Now that you have assembled your Eliobot, you will be able to program it!

In this tutorial, we will guide you to create your first program. This is a very simple test program that will allow you to get to grips with the interface and follow the line on the back of your instructions.

To your blocks 🙂

### Step 1: Discovery of the interface

#### Understanding the interface

This is how the interface is composed. This part of the explanation will be useful to you for the rest of the tutorial.

> 1. The toolbox (the space where you will find all the blocks necessary for programming).
> 
> 2. The workspace (this is where you can assemble your blocks).
> 
> 3. Tabs allowing you to access tutorials, help, as well as see the code that will be written when you place blocks.
>     
> 4. The buttons:
> - Clear everything: to clean your workspace in one click.
> - Import: opens a previously saved program.
> - Save: save your program on your computer.
> - Program: to send the code to Eliobot.



### Step 2: Creating the first program

This “test” program will allow you to follow the line found on the back of the Eliobot assembly instructions.

#### A. Line selection

The first step is to select a row. Go to your toolbox and click on the “Line tracking” block. Select the “Follow a black line” block and drag it into your workspace.

#### B. Creating a loop

This step consists of creating a loop so that Eliobot follows the line all the time (it is a very practical tool that we will use often)

Click on the “Loops” category then take the “Repeat indefinitely” block. Drag it around the blocks already present.

### Step 3: Programming the robot

#### A. Eliobot connection

Now is the time to plug in your Eliobot robot using the USB cable if you haven't already done so.

> You can see a small LED light up right next to the socket to let you know that Eliobot is charging its battery.

#### B. Code download

Send your program to Eliobot by clicking on the “Program” button at the top right.

> You can also save your blocks to use them later using the “Save” button.

#### C. Program execution

The program is now sent to Eliobot. Turn it on, place it on the black line on the back of the instructions and watch it do tricks following the line!

Congratulations on this first step towards programming. Next step, make Eliobot flash all the colors!
